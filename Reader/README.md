Events

The project is a bit rough around the edges.

Target Audience

People who are attending California State University, Monterey that want to get involved on campus.

Known bugs

RSS Feed has been updated so when a user clicks on an event, it takes them directly to the calendar and not the individual event.  

When a user access the campus map, the user's current location is not displayed.
